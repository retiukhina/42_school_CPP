DEBUG: I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-special-ketchup burger. I really do!

=== INFO ===
INFO: I cannot believe adding extra bacon costs more money. You didn't put enough bacon in my burger! If you did, I wouldn't be asking for more!

=== WARNING ===
WARNING: I think I deserve to have some extra bacon for free. I've been coming for years, whereas you started working here just last month.

=== ERROR ===
ERROR: This is unacceptable! I want to speak to the manager now.
